# Curracloe Chronicles

Curracloe Chronicles is a website that serves as a hub of information about the village of Curracloe in County Wexford, Ireland. Initially just a Facebook page, it was set up in the hope of preserving our local history and sharing memories among the community. This site is aimed at locals, tourists, and also people who have emigrated away who just miss home. This website was created as part of my Portfolio Project 1 with the Code Institute, for a Full Stack Software Developer diploma.

## Features

### Existing Features
- __Navigation Bar__
    - The fully responsive navigation bar is featured in the upper right hand side of the website on each page, including Home, Gallery and Contact Us.
    - The current page you are on is underlined in the navigation bar, helping the user understand which part of the website they're on.
    - The access to each page in the navigation bar means using the back and forwards button on the user's browser is unneeded. 

## Credits
- Instructions on how to add vertical lines between menu items were found [here on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31140935/how-do-i-add-vertical-line-on-my-menu-item-in-html-css).
- Idea for responsive hero image code came from [here] (https://codepen.io/njericooper/pen/NVRQLe).
